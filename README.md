#  CIFAR-10 Image Classification App

This project uses a deep learning model built with **TensorFlow/Keras** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. It includes a user-friendly **Streamlit interface** where users can upload an image and see classification results with prediction probabilities.

---

##  Project Features

- **CNN Model Training** on the CIFAR-10 dataset  
- **Data Augmentation** using `ImageDataGenerator`  
- **Callbacks** for early stopping and learning rate reduction  
- **Model Saving** in `.h5` format  
- **Streamlit Interface** for real-time image classification  
- **Visualization** of training accuracy and confusion matrix
